# deformable_explore
This Repository is for me to work at the robot both at home and at work.
There will be a mix of projects in this repo, but the entire point is to have this repository be a box for all the tools that I made so far about the deformable object mainpulation project. 

The repo will be structured as a big tree, and each branch will be found containing different kinds of tools. The structure that I have in mind now is: camera, robots, ROS, and other tools.

## Introduction to the project, and maybe just some thought from me.
If we think of robots as a form of life that we create, we use human beings (ourselves) as a template. I love to see this work in this way. Like look, we are literally trying to move things from human a bit and a bit to this metal artifact called robots. The logic is intuitive. We are most intuitively transferring working knowledge into the unknown fields, trying to see the transferable success. 

It is believed that robots need perception to work with this physical world. We as human beings are not able to imaging ways to interact with the world without perceptions.
